# Metal 

Metal implementation of the benchmarks for MacOS on Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

## License Notes

The XCode project used as a starting point the "Performing Calculations on a GPU" Apple Developer sample.

This was to set up any dependencies or any GPU-specific items, include relevant headers etc., and give users a supported target to debug any issues against.
